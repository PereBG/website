I'm happy to announce that as of june 2020, JobRunr has joined the OpenJdk Quality Outreach program

I was contacted by Oracle mid-May with the question to join the OpenJdk Quality Outreach program and happily said yes. This means that JobRunr is now being tested against early access builds to make sure that it continues to work against newer java versions.
