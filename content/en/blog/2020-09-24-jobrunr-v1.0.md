### Celebration time!
I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v1.0.0. It is now available from download from Maven Central.

This release contains a **breaking change**: it was decided to rename `scheduleRecurringly` to `scheduleRecurrently` as it is grammarly more correct.

### New features
- __jobrunr-spring-boot-starter__: I'm happy to announce that the integration with Spring is even easier than before thanks to the `jobrunr-spring-boot-starter`. Just add this dependency, setup some properties and you're good to go! See [GitHub issue 37](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/37)

### Breaking change
- The `jobScheduler.scheduleRecurringly` has been renamed to `jobScheduler.scheduleRecurrently`. See [GitHub issue 36](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/36) for more info.
