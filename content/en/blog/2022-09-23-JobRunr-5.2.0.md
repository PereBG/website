## Celebration time!
Summer has ended, school has started so it's about time for a new release! I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v5.2.0 (which is now available via Maven Central) and JobRunr Pro v5.2.0 which is available for customers with a subscription. Major highlights are performance improvements and a fix for one of the longest outstanding bugs in JobRunr.


### New features in JobRunr & JobRunr Pro
This release again adds some performance improvements.
- __Dashboard counters__: One of the heaviest queries JobRunr makes to your SQL database is a query that returns the counters for the dashboard and the metrics. This query has now been optimized and, depending on your database, and now uses 2 to 10 times less CPU.
- __Recurring jobs Dashboard improvements__: The recurring jobs dashboard has improved and is now paged.

### Bugfixes
- [issue 557](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/557): Severe JobRunr Exception is now fixed when a lot of exceptions happen
- [issue 448](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/448): JobRunr Skipping Recurring Jobs due to time drift
- [issue 539](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/539): Value too long for type character(128) on creation of a recurring job
