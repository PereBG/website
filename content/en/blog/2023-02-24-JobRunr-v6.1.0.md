### Celebration time!
I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v6.1.0 (which is now available via Maven Central) and JobRunr Pro v6.1.0 which is available for customers with a subscription. 

This release includes an important bugfix that surfaced during our internal load testing that exists already since JobRunr 1.0. In some cases, JobRunr does not close an InputStream resulting in a `FileSystemException` because of too many open files. See [GitHub issue 707](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/707) for more info. 

Another big improvement is that you now have more options in the [`JobServerFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.jobrunr/jobrunr/latest/org/jobrunr/jobs/filters/JobServerFilter.html), allowing you to take custom actions when a Job failed and all the retries are exhausted.

## Improvements
-  [GitHub issue 639](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/639) ![JobRunr Pro](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pro-337ab7.svg?style=flat-square&label=JobRunr) : You can now change the Recurring Job schedule from the dashboard
-  [GitHub issue 571](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/571) ![JobRunr Pro](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pro-337ab7.svg?style=flat-square&label=JobRunr) : Liquibase and Flyway support
- [GitHub issue 687](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/687) ![JobRunr Pro](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pro-337ab7.svg?style=flat-square&label=JobRunr) : Allow to have different user for SQL migrations then at runtime
- [GitHub issue 671](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/671): Allow easier mocking of JobContext: you can now call `MockJobContext.setUpJobContext(jobContext)` which helps to test Jobs using the `JobRequest` & `JobRequestHandler`
- [GitHub issue 690](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/690): Quarkus extension support for AWS DocumentDB: JobRunr now also supports AWS DocumentDB out of the box
- [GitHub issue 696](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr/issues/696): The functionality of the `JobServerFilter` has improved a lot. You can now have custom logic that will be executed when a job succeeds, fails or fails after all retries are exhausted.
