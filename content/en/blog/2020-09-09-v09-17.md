### Some small and incremental releases which added the following new features:

- __ElasticSearchStorageProvider__: a new `ElasticSearchStorageProvider` is available and allows you to use ElasticSearch 7 and up as a NoSQL database for your jobs.
- __Redis__: If you use Redis, you now have the option to use either _Jedis_ or _Lettuce_ as client library. To do so, choose one of the `StorageProviders` below:
  - `JedisRedisStorageProvider` - this is the existing Redis StorageProvider (using Jedis) but it has been renamed.
  - `LettuceRedisStorageProvider` - this is the new Redis StorageProvider (using Lettuce).

### Breaking change
- The `RedisStorageProvider` has been renamed to `JedisRedisStorageProvider`
