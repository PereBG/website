### Celebration time!
I'm pleased to announce the release of JobRunr v1.2.0. It is now available for download from Maven Central.

### New features
- __Amazon DocumentDB__: Thanks to the `AmazonDocumentDBStorageProvider` (and some changes to the `MongoDBStorageProvider`) JobRunr and JobRunr Pro now support Amazon DocumentDB.
