Join us in our first webinar ever where we will:
- **Discuss JobRunr Version 6**: an in-depth tour of new features, giving you more control and yet keep the flexibility you are used to. But we will not focus on technical details only - we will also zoom in and how you and your organization will benefit.
- **Talk about a community driven roadmap**: we want to implement a more interactive definition of future developments. You can help us define the direction to follow for future releases.
- **Have time for all your questions**: you can formulate all your questions at registration and during the webinar. If we haven't got enough time to treat all of them, we will do so in our next blog.
