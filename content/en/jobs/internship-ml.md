## Mission
This internship will allow the intern to work on a interesting optimization problem in the open-source world.

## Context
JobRunr is an [open-source](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr) cloud-native job scheduling tool that is downloaded 12.000 times / month and has processed over 9.5 billion jobs in only 8 months. It's a SDK (=jar) that can be downloaded from Maven Central and once added to a project it allows to create and schedule jobs using a simple API. These jobs are then distributed over multiple servers (e.g. Kubernetes, ...). Although it's open-source, it does not mean we're a small player: we're active in the medtech, transporation, crypto, warehousing, marketing and public governments and quite some Fortune top 100 are JobRunr users. **The world is managed by jobs** (cfr [Josh Long](https://twitter.com/starbuxman)) - let's make sure it's done well!

JobRunr also offers a Pro (paid) version which adds extra features and our next goal is to improve performance of JobRunr Pro. Various parameters have now been determined by empirical experience in JobRunr Pro but can be tuned depending on the types of jobs that are running (CPU intensive, I/O intensive). The idea is to use machine learning to determine the best value of these parameters.

## What we expect
The intern should be a master student motivated to work in the Java world and must have affinity with the open-source world and machine learning. He or she will have to understand the current software architecture of JobRunr and develop new functionalities on top of it. We expect a good understanding of computer science as a whole, but some basic competences are required for the task we propose:

- good experience with Java (or any other object oriented language)
- good experience with relational databases and NoSQL databases
- basic knowledge of Machine Learning and willing to broaden the skill-set on this topic.
- we will provide guidance but also expect you to sometimes work independently

## What we offer
A great working place, flexible hours and the possibility to put your stamp on an open-source project.
