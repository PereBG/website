## Mission
This internship will allow the intern to work on a interesting optimization problem in the open-source NoSQL world.

## Context
JobRunr is an [open-source](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr) cloud-native job scheduling tool that is downloaded 12.000 times / month and has processed over 9.5 billion jobs in only 8 months. It's a jar that can be downloaded from Maven Central and once added to a project it allows to create and schedule jobs using a simple API. These jobs are then distributed over multiple servers (e.g. Kubernetes, ...).

JobRunr currently support Redis, a NoSQL key-value datastore. The idea would be to port the existing Redis implementation to Redis Stack which is document oriented. The goal of this refactoring is to improve code readability and maintenance in the long term.

## What we expect
The intern should be a master student motivated to work in the Java world and must have affinity with the open-source world and SQL and NoSQL databases. He or she will have to understand the current software architecture of JobRunr and develop new functionalities on top of it. We expect a good understanding of computer science as a whole, but some basic competences are required for the task we propose:

- good experience with Java (or any other object oriented language)
- good experience with relational databases and NoSQL databases
- basic knowledge of Redis or willing to learn.
- we will provide guidance but also expect you to sometimes work independently
