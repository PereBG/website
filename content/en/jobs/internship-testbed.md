## Mission
This internship will allow the intern to work on setting up a testbed to perform performance testing in scenario's as close as possible to actual real world JobRunr usage.

## Context
JobRunr is an [open-source](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr) cloud-native job scheduling tool that is downloaded 12.000 times / month and has processed over 9.5 billion jobs in only 8 months. It's a SDK (=jar) that can be downloaded from Maven Central and once added to a project it allows to create and schedule jobs using a simple API. These jobs are then distributed over multiple servers (e.g. Kubernetes, ...). Although it's open-source, it does not mean we're a small player: we're active in the medtech, transporation, crypto, warehousing, marketing and public governments and quite some Fortune top 100 are JobRunr users. **The world is managed by jobs** (cfr [Josh Long](https://twitter.com/starbuxman)) - let's make sure it's done well!

JobRunr also offers a Pro (paid) version which adds extra features and our next goal is to improve performance of JobRunr Pro. To improve performance we would like to setup a testbed where we can run tests and take timings before we do any performance tuning - a.k.a the baseline. After we change some parameters or do a code refactoring related in JobRunr to performance, we would run the testbed again to see whether the results improve.

## What we expect
The intern should be a master student motivated to work in the Java world and must have affinity with the open-source world. He or she will have to understand the current software architecture of JobRunr and develop new functionalities on top of it. We expect a good understanding of computer science as a whole, but some basic competences are required for the task we propose:

- good experience with Java (or any other object oriented language)
- good experience with relational databases and NoSQL databases
- some experience with DevOps and build pipelines
- we will provide guidance but also expect you to sometimes work independently

## What we offer
A great working place, flexible hours and the possibility to put your stamp on an open-source project.
