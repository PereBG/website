Background jobs are created in a persistent storage and supports [RDBMS](documentation/installation/storage#sql-databases) like MySql/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle and also [NoSQL databases](documentation/installation/storage#nosql-databases) like Redis and MongoDB.

You can safely restart your application and use JobRunr without worrying about loosing jobs.
